![Teaser image.](examples/teaser.png) <p align="left"><b>Left:</b> Large
improvements with newly trained PWC-Net, IRR-PWC and RAFT (left: originally
published results in blue; results of our newly trained models in red). The
newly trained RAFT is more accurate than all published methods on KITTI 2015 at
the time of writing.

<b>Right:</b> Visual comparison on a Davis sequence between the original [43]
and our newly trained PWC-Net and RAFT, shows improved flow details, e.g. the
hole between the cart and the person at the back. The newly trained PWC-Net
recovers the hole between the cart and the front person better than RAFT.</p>

## Inference

### Pre-trained Models

Create a directory where you can keep large files. Ideally, not in this
directory.

```
> mkdir <pretrained_models>
```

Download pre-trained TF2 Saved Models from
[google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I2hli8O9NST-uu7RxcpLk38k2KnTDcHe?usp=sharing)
and put into `<pretrained_models>`.

The downloaded folder should have the following structure:

```
pretrained_models/
├── eccv_disentangling_architecture_and_train/
│   ├── pwc_it_pre/
│   ├── pwc_it_ft/
│   ├── raft_it_pre/
│   ├── raft_it_ft/
```

### Running the optical flow network

To run inference on examples frames we will use the
"OpticalFlow-Inference.ipynb" colab in colabs/. To run the colab, make sure that
you have installed all the required packages with the following command.

```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then make sure you have the pre-trained models downloaded to the correct folder
as shown in the section above. Then start a colab kernel using the follow
command.

```
> jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://colab.research.google.com' --port=8888   -NotebookApp.port_retries=0
```

Then navigate to the "OpticalFlow-Inference.ipynb" and run all the cells.

## Training

The src/ directory currently contains the augmentation module (the Improved
Training result uses the "pwc" augmentation from the augmentations module). The
full train loop will be posted soon.
